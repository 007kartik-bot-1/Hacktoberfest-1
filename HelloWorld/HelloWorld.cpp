We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

Oh

We're heading for Venus (Venus)
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us (seen us)
And welcome us all, yeah
With so many light years to go
And things to be found (to be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so

It's the final countdown

The final countdown,oh
It's the final count down
