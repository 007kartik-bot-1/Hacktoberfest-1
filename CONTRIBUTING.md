## Contributing

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project.

## How Can I Contribute?

Try to keep things as modular as possible, the new file/directory structure should be: 
```
/topic/sub_topic/specific/language/file(s)
```
I would prefer different languages in different files, under same topic
